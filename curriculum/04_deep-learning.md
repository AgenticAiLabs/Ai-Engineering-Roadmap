# Deep Learning for AI Engineering

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep"). Itâ€™s responsible for many of the recent advances in AI, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Understand the principles behind deep neural networks (DNNs) and their building blocks
- Implement and train deep learning models using popular libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch
- Master advanced architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Apply deep learning models to real-world tasks, including image classification, speech recognition, and time-series forecasting

## Why Itâ€™s Important

Deep Learning has revolutionized AI by enabling computers to automatically learn representations from data, eliminating the need for hand-crafted features. It powers state-of-the-art systems in computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.
