# AI Tooling

AI tooling refers to the software, libraries, and platforms that streamline development, experimentation, deployment, and collaboration in AI/ML workflows. The right tools can significantly boost your productivity and model performance.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Set up an effective environment for AI development
- Use tools for experiment tracking, model deployment, and collaboration
- Understand how to package and serve models
- Explore no-code/low-code tools for rapid prototyping

## Why Itâ€™s Important

Modern AI isn't just about building models â€” it's about **deploying**, **monitoring**, and **scaling** them in the real world. Tooling is how great ideas become actual AI products.

## Core Topics & Resources

### 1. Development Environments

- [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) â€” Interactive coding  
- [VS Code + Python AI Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/) â€” Popular IDE  
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) â€” **Free GPU** access

Covers:
- Local vs. cloud environments
- Notebooks vs. IDEs
- Hardware acceleration (GPU/TPU)

### 2. Experiment Tracking & Workflow

- [Weights & Biases (WandB)](https://wandb.ai/) â€” **Free for individuals**  
- [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) â€” Open-source experiment tracking  
- [Neptune.ai](https://neptune.ai/) â€” **Free tier available**

Covers:
- Tracking metrics, losses, and configs
- Comparing model runs and hyperparameter tuning
- Reproducibility of experiments

### 3. Model Deployment

- [FastAPI + Uvicorn Tutorial](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) â€” **Free**  
- [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) â€” No-code app demos for ML models  
- [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) â€” Free deployment

Covers:
- Serving models via API or web apps
- Creating interactive demos
- Local vs. cloud deployments

### 4. Model Packaging & Versioning

- [Docker for AI](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) â€” Containerize ML apps  
- [DVC (Data Version Control)](https://dvc.org/) â€” Track datasets and models  
- [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) â€” Portable, interoperable models

Covers:
- Keeping track of models and datasets across projects
- Reproducible ML pipelines
- Sharing and deploying portable models

### 5. Collaboration & Open Source

- [Git & GitHub](https://github.com/) â€” Version control and collaboration  
- [Hugging Face Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) â€” Pretrained models + sharing  
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) â€” Competitions + community notebooks

Covers:
- How to contribute to open-source AI tools
- Sharing models, datasets, and projects with others
- Finding reusable components for your AI stack

## Suggested Projects & Practice

- Deploy a model as a web app using Gradio or FastAPI
- Track and compare training experiments with WandB or MLflow
- Package a project with Docker for local + cloud use
- Use Hugging Face Spaces to host a working demo

## Checkpoint: Before You Move On
You should now be able to:

- Set up an AI dev environment
- Track, package, and deploy your models
- Use tools to collaborate and share your work
- Choose the right tools based on your AI project stage
