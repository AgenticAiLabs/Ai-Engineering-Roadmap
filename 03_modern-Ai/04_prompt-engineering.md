# Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing effective inputs (prompts) to guide large language models (LLMs) in generating accurate, useful, or creative outputs. As models grow in capability, good prompts become the key to unlocking their full potential.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Understand different prompt formats and strategies
- Apply prompting techniques like zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought
- Use structured prompting, templates, and prompt chaining
- Evaluate and iterate on prompts for consistent results

## Why Itâ€™s Important

Prompting is often more powerful than fine-tuning. It allows you to leverage pretrained models effectively without modifying them â€” ideal for prototyping, RAG, and agent-based systems.
