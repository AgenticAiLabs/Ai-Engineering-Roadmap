# Capstone Projects

Capstone projects bring everything you’ve learned into real-world, end-to-end AI applications. These projects are designed to showcase your technical depth, creativity, and readiness to work as an AI engineer.

You’ll define the problem, build and train models, evaluate results, and deploy your solution.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of your capstone experience, you should be able to:

- Design and implement full-stack AI systems
- Handle real-world data and edge cases
- Collaborate using Git, Docker, or CI/CD pipelines
- Communicate your project’s purpose and results clearly

## Capstone Ideas

Choose one or more projects below, or design your own! Try to scope your first capstone to 2–4 weeks.

### 1. AI Chat Assistant (RAG + LLM)

Build a domain-specific chatbot that can answer questions from custom documents using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

- Tools: LangChain / Haystack, OpenAI or Hugging Face LLMs, Chroma or FAISS
- Bonus: Add a Gradio or Streamlit interface

### 2. Image Classifier + Deployment

Train a deep learning model to classify custom images (e.g. plant diseases, food, art).

- Tools: PyTorch/TensorFlow, FastAPI or Gradio, Hugging Face
- Bonus: Host on Hugging Face Spaces or Render

### 3. Multi-Class Text Classifier

Build a pipeline to classify documents or tweets by topic or sentiment.

- Tools: scikit-learn or Hugging Face Transformers
- Bonus: Include preprocessing steps and visualizations

### 4. AI Agent for Task Automation

Use LangChain + Tools to build an LLM agent that can search, summarize, or complete repetitive tasks.

- Tools: LangChain Agents, SerpAPI, Browser tools
- Bonus: Add memory and goal-based workflows

### 5. Reinforcement Learning Game Agent

Train an RL agent to play a simple game (e.g. CartPole, Flappy Bird, custom env).

- Tools: OpenAI Gym, Stable-Baselines3
- Bonus: Visualize learning progress and game play


## Project Deliverables

- Clean and well-commented code
- Project `README.md` (overview, usage, setup)
- At least one form of result sharing:  
  - Live demo  
  - GitHub repo  
  - Blog post or video walkthrough


## ✅ Final Capstone Checklist

- [ ] Solved a meaningful problem with AI
- [ ] Clean codebase with modular structure
- [ ] Clear documentation (README, setup steps)
- [ ] Demo or deployment available
- [ ] Shared publicly (GitHub, Spaces, etc.)

Congratulations on completing the AI Engineering Curriculum!  
You now have the knowledge and tools to build and contribute to real-world AI systems.
