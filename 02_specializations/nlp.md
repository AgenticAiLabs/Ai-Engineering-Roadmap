# Natural Language Processing (NLP) for AI Engineering

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a specialized area of AI focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. From chatbots to machine translation, NLP powers many of todayâ€™s most common AI applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Understand the key concepts in NLP such as tokenization, stemming, and part-of-speech tagging
- Implement NLP techniques using Python and libraries like NLTK, SpaCy, and Hugging Face
- Build models for tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), and machine translation
- Work with pre-trained language models and fine-tune them for custom tasks

## Why Itâ€™s Important

NLP is the cornerstone of AI systems that deal with human language. It is central to virtual assistants, search engines, social media analysis, and many other industries. Understanding NLP is key for building modern AI systems that interact with humans in natural, meaningful ways.
